# Cyberpatriot Scoring Engine
This will be a program that records points for changes in configuration and
state on another system. It is not usable yet, but should be soon. Client
programs ran on the testing machine will authenticate and send scores which
will be held in a database.

# Roadmap
* Make it work

* Use a database (probably SQLite) to store the scoring information

* Set up an authentication scheme

* Make TLS an option to secure communication
